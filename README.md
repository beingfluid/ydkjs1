This is a series of books diving deep into the core mechanisms of the JavaScript
language. The first edition of the series is now complete. Also, these
first-edition books are now **out of print** and can no longer be purchased.
They can only be read for free online here in this markdown format.

## Contributions

These first-edition books are complete and published and will not be changed in
any way, so there's no further need for contributions. They will remain here for
posterity, but are not being maintained. See the
[2nd edition books](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/2nd-ed) for
the active work in this repository.
